### Overview

For this exercise we were asked to analaze a dataset related to coupon offers to drivers for nearby
businesses such as Bars, Coffee Shops, and Restaurants. We were asked to analyze the data, create
charts, and find patterns. The first half of the assignment was guided, the second half was open-ended.

### Summary of Findings:
### First Half:
The first half analysis focused on drivers who were ofered a Bar coupon, and grouped them by criteria 
such as how often they visited a bar in a month, their marital status and whether they had children
passengers or not.

Based on the analsyis, there was a much higher acceptance rate for Bar coupons for:

1. Drivers who go to bars more than 3 times a month (76%)
1. Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 (72%)
1. Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and are not widowed (71%)

All 3 of these groups had bar coupon acceptance rates well above the mean bar coupon acceptance rate (~ 40%) across the population of drivers who accepted bar coupons.

### Second Half:
After looking at several different sets of data, I chose to focus on drivers who were offered Coffee Shop coupons. 

Analysis indicated that there is a significantly higher coupon acceptance rate among drivers in certain age groups who already visit a coffee shop a few times a month (66% for 46 and over; 69% for 26 and under) vs.those who visit less frequently or never visit (37% for men in this group; 30% for women in this group). The mean acceptance rate for this coupon across all drivers was 50%.

### Next Steps & Recommendations:
I believe this analysis could be useful for the marketing department of a Coffee Shop chain, who could decide if there would be positive for running a local offers campaign. The data indicates that the marketing team should tailor their marketing strategy and/or contnet based on target audience, e.g. repeat customers in certain age brackets, or infrequent customers in different gender groups.
