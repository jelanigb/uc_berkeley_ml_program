# UC Berkeley Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

**Author**: Jelani Gould-Bailey

This repository holds my coursework and related code for the [UC Berkeley Professional Certificate 
in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](), which I am enrolled in for the Fall 2025 - Spring 2026 cycle.

During the course we will learn and apply data cleansing, data analysis, and data science techniques, 
including the implementation and usage of different machine learning algorithms in Python.

Throughout the course we will complete 3 Practical Assignments and 1 Capstone Project. Code for all
projects will be added here as it is completed.
